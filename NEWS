0.2.0 (2014-05-06)
------------------

 * Add support for protocol decoding.
   - A menu item Decoders->Add can add (only) low-level protocol decoders.
   - Clicking on a decoder's arrow on the left-hand side allows stacking
     (only) further, higher-level decoders (bug #333).
   - Add support for multiple decoder rows per PD (bugs #161, #303).
 * Add support for loading data from input files.
 * Add support for saving logic analyzer data in *.sr files (bug #245).
 * Show the filename of loaded *.sr files as "device name" in a drop-down.
 * Add support for the new "channel groups" feature in libsigrok.
 * Add a "Zoom to fit" and a "Zoom 1:1" icon/button.
 * Add a "Channels" icon/button for enabling and configuring device channels.
 * Add a "Device options" icon/button for configuring device specific settings
   such as voltage thresholds.
 * Double-clicking will zoom into the location the cursor points to.
 * Add shortcut keys for Zoom-in (CTRL++) and Zoom-out (Ctrl+-) (bug #235).
 * Add initial, basic support for analog data sources, such as oscilloscopes.
   This has been tested on e.g. the Rigol DS1052E oscilloscope (bug #127).
 * Almost all operations in PulseView work in an "auto-apply" style, i.e.
   any changes in the GUI popups (decoder channel assignment, decoder option
   changes, device channel changes, device option changes, and so on) have an
   immediate effect (you don't have to click on any "OK" buttons).
 * Open file dialog: Add 'All files' selection possibility.
 * Added GUI support for the following libsigrok config options:
   - SR_CONF_VOLTAGE_THRESHOLD
   - SR_CONF_TRIGGER_SLOPE
   - SR_CONF_EXTERNAL_CLOCK
   - SR_CONF_CLOCK_EDGE
 * Updated build requirements:
   - cmake >= 2.8.6 (required)
   - libsigrok >= 0.3.0 (required)
   - libsigrokdecode >= 0.3.0 (required)
     Note: libsigrokdecode is now always required (was optional before).
   - libboost-filesystem >= 1.42 (required)
   - libboost-test >= 1.42 (optional, only needed for running unit tests)
 * Fix a build issue on NetBSD due to an incorrect #include.
 * Fix a channel handling issue for devices with >= 16 channels.
 * Fixed a few display issues related to UTF-8 strings in decoder annotations,
   decoder options, and so on (bug #307, and other fixes without bug numbers).
 * Don't decode if required PD channels were not supplied (bug #204).
 * Fix some issues with partially disappearing PD annotations.
 * Update the samplerate selector when the device config changes (since e.g.
   en-/disabling logic analyzer channels can change available samplerates).
 * Fix a samplerate selector and device config update issue (bug #296).
 * Minor performance improvements via memory pre-allocation in some areas.
 * Remove old PD annotations upon new captures (bugs #172, #302).
 * Portability improvements by using portable sample pack/unpack code.
 * Fix a segfault related to thread joining (bug #323).
 * Fix a minor issue which lead to trigger config being unusable (bug #318).
 * Fix an issue which lead to the user-selected samplerate in the drop-down
   box not being selected and shown again after clicking "Run" (bug #324).
 * Start a new decode session whenever a new frame begins.
 * Fix an issue which arose when a session file load failed (bug #331).
 * Fix a segfault if only exactly one libsigrok driver is available (bug #334).
 * Fix an issue with channel names not being updated while typing (bug #338).
 * Fix an issue by stopping the capture when a device is changed (bug #223).
 * Fix an issue with the displayed cursor popup time (bug #229).
 * Fix handling of different integer types in some properties (bug #203).
 * Hide the 'Configure device' button when the popup would be empty (bug #232).
 * Fix a decoding chunk buffer / unitsize issue (bugs #171, #225).
 * Fix a zoom issue due to invalid samplerate, assume 1Hz if needed (bug #278).
 * Fix a QWellArray related issue by dropping QT_NO_MENU code (bug #265).
 * Fix an analog data channel interleaving issue (bug #279).
 * Only show the sample count widget if needed (i.e., hide it for scopes).
 * SweepTimingWidget: Show a 1-2-5 based list for samplerate and samplecount.
 * Fixed a unit test issue with AnalogSegmentTest (bug #286).
 * Add an extra sample to edges to make the end sample visible (bug #280).
 * Fix an issue with decoder errors being shown even after the error was fixed.
 * Add support for SR_CONF_LIMIT_SAMPLES (device-specific limits) (bug #74).
 * Windows:
   - Use the sigrok logo as icon for pulseview.exe (bugs #110, #238).
   - Fix SVG icons not being displayed on Windows (bug #239).
   - Ship libusb0.dll in the NSIS based installer (bug #241).
   - Additionally ship decoders, firmware files, example *.sr files, and
     zadig.exe and zadig_xp.exe in the NSIS based installer.
   - Fix a "working path" issue resulting in PDs not being usable.
 * Device scan: Disable "OK" button if no devices were found (bug #237).
 * Fix a segfault related to incorrect decoder option handling (bug #160).
 * Fix an off-by-one issue resulting in one PD not being usable (bug #164).
 * Fix a PD channel auto-select logic issue with optional channels (bug #310).
 * Fix an issue when cancelling "Connect to Device" (bug #242).
 * Avoid confusing annotation color changes (bug #311).
 * Fix an issue that caused some decoded data to not be shown (bug #308).
 * Don't allow disabled channels (channel arrows) to be selected (bug #313).
 * The channel name field is now resized to always fit the contents (bug #167).
 * Build fixes for systems with (among other versions) Qt5 installed.
 * Fix a build issue related to missing libboost-filesystem (bug #133).
 * Add Cotire (optional, disabled by default) support for build performance.
 * Fix a build issue related to Cotire (bug #217).
 * Fix an issue with missing channel names from loaded files (bug #126).
 * Fix missing samplerate loading from session files (bug #123).
 * Fix some build issues related to C++ namespaces (bug #196).
 * Fix a file loading issue which triggered an assert (bug #320).
